# Python-API-Challenge
## In this challenge I reviewed the principals of scraping data using Geoapify and Weather API keys and then cleaning the data to prepare it for visualization and making different databases based on my own preference.

## I worked with Chris Livesay and  Drew Johnson on this project who were great references in completing this code. I was also able to use google to help find the answers to questions I had.

# Data Used
- I used the starter code that was given at the beginning of the assignment
- I Created two Jupiter Notebooks: Weatherpy and Vacationpy

# Analysis
- I went over different weather correlations using different plots as visual aids
